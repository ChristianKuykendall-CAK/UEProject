SCRIPTING

I added run and crouch to UEProjectCharacter.cpp and header files

I added landscape and buildings and sculpted the mountain

I added a player avatar animation for idle, walking, running, and crouching

I added enemies that shoot objects at the player once the player enters the sphere radius

I added orbs that the player can pickup to complete the level

I added foliage from an imported pack
